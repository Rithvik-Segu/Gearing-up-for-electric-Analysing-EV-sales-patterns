This project delves into the evolving dynamics of electric vehicle (EV) usage in Washington State, executed through meticulous data analysis and machine learning techniques. By processing extensive datasets from federal sources, we concentrated on EV registrations to discern patterns and preferences. We applied rigorous data cleaning to ensure precision, then harnessed Python's analytical power to group, merge, and visualize the data, revealing the most extensive-range EV models and the dominant market players. Our analysis pipeline provided a clear depiction of the growth in EV adoption, highlighting a significant market shift towards higher-range BEVs. The study not only reflects the current state of EV popularity but also serves as a bellwether for the industry's forward momentum.
